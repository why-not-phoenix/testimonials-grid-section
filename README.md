### What I learned

This was more challenging than I wanted. I was bent on using Bootstrap at first to improve my skills but I met a dead end. How do you create gaps on Bootstrap without ruining the whole design?
If you have a link of anyone that used bootstrap to complete this challenge it'll be much appreciated.
Anyway, I had to scrap everything and start over w/o Bootstrap. Spent less time, which I guess the idea of Bootstrap is to reduce time spent? maybe cos this is relatively small I won't appreciate that. I guess it came out okay at the end but with minor font issues. Couldn't get the correct font-size.
That's all I have to say for now, criticisms are welcomed.

### Continued development

Bootstrap.
Need to start coding with responsiveness and accessibility in mind.
